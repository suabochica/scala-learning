# ğŸš§ Session 3: Build tools, developer workflow, modules, encapsulation

## ğŸš§  Tooling

### ğŸš§  Organize Code

In summary, large Scala projects are split into multiple files. Source files contain definitions organized into **packages**. You can impor entities to not have to write their fullu qualified name every times.

### âœ… Build Tools

As a developer whe you work on a program you need:

- compile
- run
- test
- deploy

Some of these tasks can be performed by a continuos integration server, or, may be automatically triggered on source changes.

So, an important question is what is to compile a program? The answer in the context of Scala is invoking the compiler on all the source files to turn them into executable JVM bytecode. this process require:

- constructing the application classpath by fetching library dependencies,
- generating parts of the source code or resources (e.g., assets, data, type serializers, etc.)

Building an execution environment (i.e, a JVM with the correct classpath), invoking the entry points, requires compiling the program.

Also, execute tast like:

- publish an artifact on a library repository,
- package the program and its dependencies as a single `.jar` file,
- publish a Docker image
- publish documentacion
- ...

requires compiling the program.

Invoke manually these tasks (compiling, fetching dependencies, etc.) in the right order is cumbersome. Instead **build tools** can manage these task for you.

Idea: you indicate where you program source files are located, which libraries your program depends on, and the build tool takes care of feteching the dependencies, invoking the compiler, running the test, and more.

Generally, build tools are not limited to a specific developer workflow but implement a generic task engine able to coordinate the execution of a graph of tasks.

```mermaid
  graph tasks TD;
      A[fetch]-->B[compile];
      B-->C[run];
      B-->D[deploy];
```

In summary, working oin program involves performin various independent ta sks such as compiling, running, and deploying the program. Build tools aim at simplifyin the coordination of these tasks.
### ğŸš§ Introduction to `sbt`

`sbt` is a build tool commonly used in Scala.

> Note: there are other build tools that support Scala: Maven, Gradle, Mill, etc.

Make sure the sbt command-line tool is installed accordin to the instruction in the [sbt's oficial site](https://scala-sbt.org)

As sbt project is a directory with the following two files:

- `project/build.properties`: defines the version of sbt we want to use
- `built.sbt`: defines the configuration of the project
