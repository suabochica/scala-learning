# Reasoning About Code, Testing
The recommendation in Scala is to use immutable data types by default. Indeed, they have desirable properties such as being thread-safe and allowing local reasoning. However, in some cases, mutable variables lead to simpler code, as you will see in the lectures. We then dive into different testing techniques such as unit testing, property-based testing, integration testing, and mocking.

#### Learning Objectives
- Understand the tradeoffs of using mutable values vs immutable values
- Write unit tests
- Write property-based tests
- Write mocks
